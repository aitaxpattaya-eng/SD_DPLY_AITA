### Course Title (required)

```plain
Tax Prep Pro Setup Guide — How We Configured Your SuiteDash
```

### Summary

```kotlin
A 10-module guided tour, narrated by your AI avatar instructor Zuri, that walks you through exactly how your Tax Prep Pro SuiteDash was configured to fulfill every tax-return order — phase by phase, click by click.
```

### Course Description (rich text)

```swift
You are the provider. The taxpayer placed an order. Your job is to deliver the product — a tax return — without dropping anything along the way.

This course shows you how your SuiteDash setup is configured to help you do exactly that. It is not a tax-law course. It is not an IRS publications walkthrough. It is a click-by-click tour of the system you are about to use every day, narrated by Zuri — your AI avatar instructor — across all 10 modules.

The course is built around the order-fulfillment metaphor. The taxpayer's order moves through 8 phases, from identifying the taxpayer all the way to delivering the return and closing the engagement. Each module takes one phase and shows you how it was set up, where the buttons are, and what to change if you want to customize it.

By the end, you will go from "this system is big" to "I know exactly how this flows." If you get stuck, every lesson page has a button to book a Support Call.
```

**Phase order note:** Modules 2–9 follow the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 6 — matching Module 1's script. Phase 6 (E-Sign) is taught last because it is a cross-cutting capability that touches multiple earlier phases.
