# SD Appointment Generator config — Tax Monitor (Item 29352) mirror

**Purpose:** Reference for manually configuring the four **Tax Monitor** SuiteDash Appointment Generators
(`CRM → Appointments → Appointment Generator → Edit Generator`). Each block is extracted from its
canonical (`canonicals/tmp/29352/deal/appts/`) using the schema in
[`module-config/m001-appointments.md`](../module-config/m001-appointments.md).

**Source:** mirrored 1:1 from the TPP siblings under `Item: 29355 – Appts` with `Tax Prep → Tax Monitor`
swapped (JLW's mirror rule — no monitoring-semantics rewrite). The CU pages live in the **Tax Monitor**
doc `80djf-83557` under `Tax Monitor Setup – Deal > Item: 29352 – Appts` (`80djf-737317`).

## Legend
- **Populated** — value carried over from the canonical body (verify against live SD).
- **`[MIRROR FROM TPP SIBLING]`** — requires live SD inspection / a TMP-specific value the canonical can't supply.
- **`[TBD]`** — an open decision flagged below.

## Cross-cutting flags (apply to all four)
1. **Calendar-Only Settings (calendar IDs).** The two `updateCalendar/<id>` URLs in each canonical are the
   **TPP** calendar IDs (placeholders). The TMP generators need their **own** calendar IDs →
   `[MIRROR FROM TPP SIBLING]` once the TMP generators exist in SD.
2. **Icon `[TBD]`.** All four reference the shared TPP asset `Item: 29355 – JLW_200x200_head`
   (intentionally reused). **Decision:** kept as the 29355 shared asset (per JLW). Confirm whether TMP
   should keep this shared icon or use a TMP-specific asset.
3. **Automation links.** The Booked/Rescheduled/Canceled/Completed rows show **TPP** automation pages
   (e.g. `80djf-7229xx`, in doc `80djf-83497`) with text swapped to "Tax Monitor". These are placeholders —
   wire each trigger to the real **TMP** automation when built → `[MIRROR FROM TPP SIBLING]`.
4. **Pricing.** Not present in any observed body (all free calls). `_n/a — free_` unless SD says otherwise →
   `[MIRROR FROM TPP SIBLING]` for any paid config.
5. **Content note — "filing steps" (Discovery).** Kept verbatim per JLW's mirror rule. Tax Monitor is IRS
   compliance monitoring (not return filing), so this clause has no clean TM analog — revisit during SD copy review.
